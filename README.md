# No Javascript Captcha
This is a no javascript captcha system built in expressJS. It's very rudimentary and there are flaws that would need to be fixed to use this in a real app (such as a small set of images and the image URLs being static). I made this because I've seen no-js captcha solutions before and I've always been interested in how they work. I'm learning sessions and I figured this would be cool way to use them because storing the results of a captcha seemed like a perfect use for a session. I think a way to improve this app (besides addressing the vulnerabilities listed above) would be to add a multi-stage challenge. I think this could be done with one request to the server using hidden checkboxes that change display properties.
